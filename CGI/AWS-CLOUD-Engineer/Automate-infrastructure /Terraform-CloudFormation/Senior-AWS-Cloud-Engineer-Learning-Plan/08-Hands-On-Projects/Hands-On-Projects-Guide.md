#### Week 16: Testing, Validation, and Documentation
**Day 15-17: DR Testing Framework**
```python
# Automated DR testing framework
class DRTestSuite:
    def __init__(self):
        self.test_results = []
    
    def test_database_failover(self):
        """Test Aurora Global Database failover"""
        start_time = time.time()
        
        # Simulate primary region failure
        self.simulate_primary_failure()
        
        # Measure failover time
        failover_time = self.measure_failover_time()
        
        # Validate data consistency
        data_consistency = self.validate_data_consistency()
        
        self.test_results.append({
            'test': 'database_failover',
            'rto_met': failover_time < 900,  # 15 minutes
            'rpo_met': data_consistency,
            'failover_time': failover_time
        })
    
    def test_application_failover(self):
        """Test application tier failover"""
        # Scale down primary region
        # Scale up DR region
        # Validate application functionality
        pass
    
    def test_dns_failover(self):
        """Test Route 53 DNS failover"""
        # Simulate health check failure
        # Validate DNS resolution changes
        # Measure DNS propagation time
        pass
    
    def generate_report(self):
        """Generate comprehensive DR test report"""
        report = {
            'test_date': datetime.now().isoformat(),
            'overall_status': 'PASS' if all(t['rto_met'] for t in self.test_results) else 'FAIL',
            'detailed_results': self.test_results,
            'recommendations': self.generate_recommendations()
        }
        return report
```
