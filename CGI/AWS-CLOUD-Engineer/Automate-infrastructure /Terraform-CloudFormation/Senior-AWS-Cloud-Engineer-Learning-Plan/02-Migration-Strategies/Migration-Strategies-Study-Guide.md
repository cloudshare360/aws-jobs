## Module Overview: The 6 R's of Migration

### 1. Rehost (Lift-and-Shift)
**When to Use:** Quick migration with minimal changes
**Tools:** AWS Application Migration Service, CloudEndure
**Timeline:** Fastest migration approach
**Considerations:** May not leverage cloud-native benefits

### 2. Replatform (Lift-Tinker-and-Shift)
**When to Use:** Optimize without changing core architecture
**Examples:** Migrate to RDS, use Elastic Beanstalk
**Benefits:** Some cloud optimization without major refactoring
**Effort:** Moderate complexity

### 3. Repurchase (Drop-and-Shop)
**When to Use:** Replace with SaaS solutions
**Examples:** Move to Salesforce, Office 365, Workday
**Benefits:** Reduced maintenance overhead
**Considerations:** Data migration and integration challenges

### 4. Refactor/Re-architect
**When to Use:** Maximize cloud benefits
**Approach:** Redesign for cloud-native architecture
**Benefits:** Best performance, scalability, cost optimization
**Effort:** Most complex and time-consuming

### 5. Retire
**When to Use:** Eliminate redundant applications
**Benefits:** Cost savings, reduced complexity
**Process:** Decommission safely with data archival

### 6. Retain (Revisit)
**When to Use:** Not ready for migration
**Reasons:** Complex dependencies, compliance requirements
**Action:** Plan for future migration phases
